## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide W. Avy with temperature trends for Oahu, specifically in the months June and December. W. Avy would like to know if the surf and ice cream shop can remain open throughout the year.

## Findings

Below are the results from the analysis:
* As shown in the table below, the statistics for June show the min and max temperature to be within 64 and 85, with the mean being 75 degrees. This temperature falls within the range of surfing and ice cream.

* December shows to be somewhat cooler than June, as the minimum temperature is 56, with a mean of 71. This may be too cold to leave the shop open all month.
* However, the max temperature of 83 means that some days the ice cream and surf shop would do just fine in December. Below is the result fo the December temperature statistics:

## Summary

Overall I think the surf shop is a great business idea for W. Avy, based on weather alone.

I think a few additional items I would like to query would be rainy days vs sunny days and windy days vs calm days. Surfers like big waves, so I would want to know the windiest days!
